## Project 1 Assignment:
This project encapsulates the material we learned during quarter 1 of UCSD DSC Captsone Section B12 2023-24. This quarter we learned about Graph Neural Networks and how to capture long-range dependencies on common GNN architectures. 

## Usage
1. Clone this repository on your local machine
2. Open your terminal
3. cd into the directory of your cloned repo. 
4. Type  ``` pip install -r requirements.txt```. This contains all the necessary packages for running the code.
5. Use run.py to execute the code. Type ```python run.py {insert dataset}``` in your terminal. The following models will run on the dataset of your selection: GCN, GIN, GAT, and Graph GPS. You can choose from 'cora', 'imdb', 'enzymes', or 'pascal' datasets to insert after the 'run.py' command and run all 4 models on.


## Requirements
1) Python 3
2) Libraries listed in requirements.txt
